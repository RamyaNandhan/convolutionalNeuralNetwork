🚧 Helmet Detection using Deep Learning

📌 Overview



This project builds an end-to-end computer vision system to automatically detect whether a person is wearing a safety helmet. It leverages deep learning to improve workplace safety by enabling scalable and real-time monitoring.



Manual safety checks are often inconsistent and inefficient. This solution automates the process, reducing risk and ensuring compliance in industrial environments such as construction sites and factories.



🎯 Problem Statement



Ensuring that workers consistently wear safety helmets is critical but challenging due to:



Manual monitoring limitations

Human error

Lack of scalability

💡 Solution



A deep learning-based image classification model that classifies images into:



✅ Helmet

❌ No Helmet



The system is designed to:



Work in real-world conditions

Handle variations in lighting and angles

Be easily extendable to real-time deployment

📊 Dataset

Total Images: \~4,125

Classes:

Helmet: 3,161

No Helmet: 964

Data Processing
